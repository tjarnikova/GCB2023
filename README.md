This folder contains scripts and outputs for the greenocean group's GCB submission.

Contents:

- `./submissionData2023`: contains data
- 
- `./scripts` contains scripts that produce output, with the batch submission file `runGCB.bsub`, that can be run using `sbatch < runGCB.bsub` 
    - Note: currently `runGCB.bsub` requires some python packages that are contained in an environment called swamp2 (notably arrow), if you are running this in the future and it's not working, check imports.
